The goal of this project is to provide a working Continuous Integration Server to a client in just a few minutes.  Very often with tools like Cruise Control and NAnt it can take a few days to a few weeks for a client to produce a working server.  CI Factory takes these products and integrates them for you.  If you abide by the naming conventions and directory structure laid down by CI Factory it will just work.  Similar to Ruby there is a focus on convention over configuration.

There are many packages that come with CI Factory.  In the current Beta 0.8 there are 25 packages.  Here are some:

  * Alerts
  * Analytics
  * CSDiff
  * DotNetUnitTest
  * FinalBuilder
  * InstallShield
  * MSBuild
  * MSTest
  * NCover
  * nDepend
  * Simian
  * Subversion
  * Tracker
  * Vault
  * Versioning
  * VisualSourceSafe
  * VS.NETCompile
  * VSTSVersionControl
  * Wix
  * XenocodePostbuild
